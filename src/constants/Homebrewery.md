# Homebrewery Markdown Preview

Greetings friend! Pull up a chair and listen to my tale; it is a story of a GM with grand ideas, but frustrated with an online Markdown editor that isn't quite up to par. He channeled his angst into his own little helper, a Visual Studio Code extension to solve his woes.

### Homebrew D&D

The [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) is a wonderful online tool for creating homebrew D&D content that looks like it came straight out of the Player's Handbook. With markdown and a little CSS magic, it turns bland text into readable, flavorful homebrew content. How else are you going to share your custom anime protagonist background or your homemade lightsaber weapon stat block?

### The Problem & The Solution

However, the Homebrewery's online editor leaves something to be desired. Bare syntax highlighting combined with minimal tooling can be a frustrating experience.

My solution was to create an extension for Visual Studio Code that would allow me to do my homebrew editing there in a much more powerful application.

> ##### Did You Know
> This extension includes a number of snippets for creating descriptions, statblocks, and notes just like this one? Wow! What a great value!

## What it does
The extension shows your homebrew content as you type in VS Code's markdown preview window. Toggling the homebrew styling on/off is easy with a command from the command palette.

## Where to get it
The extension can be found in the extensions pane of Visual Studio Code or [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=officerhalf.homebrewery-vscode).
