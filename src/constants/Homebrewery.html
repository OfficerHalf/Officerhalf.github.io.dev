        Greetings friend! Pull up a chair and listen to my tale; it is a story
        of a GM with grand ideas, but frustrated with an online Markdown editor
        that isn't quite up to par. He channeled his angst into his own little
        helper, a Visual Studio Code extension to solve his woes.
      </p>

        Homebrew D&amp;D
      </h3>
      <p data-line="6" class="code-line">
        The <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/">Homebrewery</a> is a
        wonderful online tool for creating homebrew D&amp;D content that looks
        like it came straight out of the Player's Handbook. With markdown and a
        little CSS magic, it turns bland text into readable, flavorful homebrew
        content. How else are you going to share your custom anime protagonist
        background or your homemade lightsaber weapon stat block?
      </p>

        The Problem &amp; The Solution
      </h3>
      <p data-line="10" class="code-line">
        However, the Homebrewery's online editor leaves something to be desired.
        Bare syntax highlighting combined with minimal tooling can be a
        frustrating experience.
      </p>
      <p data-line="12" class="code-line">
        My solution was to create an extension for Visual Studio Code that would
        allow me to do my homebrew editing there in a much more powerful
        application.

          Did You Know
        </h5>
        <p data-line="18" class="code-line">
          This extension includes a number of snippets for creating
          descriptions, statblocks, and notes just like this one? Wow! What a
          great value!

        The extension shows your homebrew content as you type in VS Code's
        markdown preview window. Toggling the homebrew styling on/off is easy
        with a command from the command palette.
